== INTRODUCTION

=== Overview

VDVDVDVD This document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, and identity and mark proofing requirements that are necessary for the issuance and management of Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs) - certificates that are trusted by Consuming Entities. Upon adoption, they are mandatory for Certification Authorities who issue or plan to issue Verified Mark Certificates.

WWWWWWW VMCs assert a cryptographically verifiable and auditable binding between an identity, a logo, and a domain. The key pair of an end entity VMC is unused, and there are no requirements around the generation, storage, and protection of such key pairs. In particular, Certification Authorities MAY generate such key pairs on behalf of their customers, and VMCs need not be revoked if the unused key pair is compromised.

VMCs present Consuming Entities and Relying Parties with information about and marks asserted by the Mark Asserting Entity, some of which is gathered from legal documents and government registries (including trademark registries). When Mark Verifying Authorities verify marks presented by a Mark Asserting Entity for inclusion in a VMC, or when Mark Verifying Authorities present VMCs and the information or marks they contain to Consuming Entities, or when Consuming Entities present VMCs and the information or marks they contain to Relying Parties, they are not providing legal advice to any party.

In adopting these Verified Mark Certificate Requirements (VMCR), the AuthIndicators Working Group is not providing legal advice to any party. All parties (Mark Asserting Entities, Mark Verifying Authorities, Consuming Entities and Relying Parties) are advised to consult their own legal counsel on all matters.

Mark Verifying Authorities have no legal obligation to issue VMCs to any Mark Asserting Entity. Consuming Entities have no legal obligation to use or display VMCs or the information or marks they contain to any Relying Party, and may choose at their sole discretion not to use or display VMCs (or groups or categories of VMCs) or the information or marks they contain to Relying Parties or to any subset of Relying Parties they may choose.

Verified Mark Certificates may be issued with respect to marks accredited by legislation (such as Registered Marks that are in good standing with a Trademark Office) and which are owned by or licensed to the Applicant. CAs may issue Verified Mark Certificates provided that the CA satisfies the requirements in this document.

All Subscribers/Mark Asserting Entities, Consuming Entities, and Relying Parties are bound by the VMC Terms attached as <<terms-of-use>> according to their terms. CAs who issue Verified Mark Certificates SHALL include the VMC Terms in their applicable Certification Practice Statement.

Relevant sections of these VMCRs have been synchronized with the following versions of the CA/Browser Forum standards:

* Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates v1.7.0
* Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation Certificates v1.7.2

This document may be synchronized from time to time with future versions of the CA/Browser Forum documents at the sole discretion of the AuthIndicators Working Group. However, this document is independent of any actions of the CA/Browser Forum or of its documents.

=== Document name and Identification

This document SHALL be known as the Verified Mark Certificate Requirements (or “VMC Requirements” or simply “VMCR”). These VMC Requirements SHALL take effect upon public adoption by one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) that offer Verified Mark Certificates to Subscribers and by one or more Consuming Entities that recognize and utilize the Verified Mark Certificates.

==== Verified Mark Certificate OIDs

Certificates adhering to these VMC Requirements SHALL be identified by the presence of the VMC policy OID in the Certificate Policies Extension as described in <<_certificate_policy_object_identifier>>.

=== PKI Participants

The AuthIndicators Working Group is a voluntary organization that maintains these VMC Requirements. These will be published at https://www.bimigroup.org[www.bimigroup.org].

==== Certification Authorities

Certification Authority (CA), also known as Mark Verifying Authority, is defined in <<_definitions>>.

==== Registration Authorities

With the exception of <<_validation_of_domain_authorization_or_control>>, the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of <<_initial_identity_validation>> requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of <<_initial_identity_validation>>.

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

. Meet the qualification requirements of <<_qualifications_experience_and_clearance_requirements>>, when applicable to the delegated function;
. Retain documentation in accordance with <<_retention_period_for_archive>>;
. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
. Comply with:
.. the CA's Certificate Policy/Certification Practice Statement; or
.. the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

The CA MAY designate an Enterprise RA to verify certificate requests from the Enterprise RA's own organization.

The CA SHALL NOT accept certificate requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

. The CA SHALL confirm that the requested Fully-Qualified Domain Name(s) are within the Enterprise RA's verified Domain Namespace.
. If the certificate request includes a Subject name of a type other than a Fully-Qualified Domain Name, the CA SHALL confirm that the name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name “XYZ Co.” on the authority of Enterprise RA “ABC Co.”, unless the two companies are affiliated (see <<_initial_identity_validation>>) or “ABC Co.” is the agent of “XYZ Co”. This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested Subject FQDN falls within the Domain Namespace of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA.

==== Subscribers

Subscribers may also be known as Mark Asserting Entities. Both are as defined in <<_definitions>>.

==== Relying Parties

“Relying Party” and “Application Software Supplier” and “Consuming Entities” are defined in <<_definitions>>.

==== Other Participants

Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the CPA Canada WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force. Participation by CPA Canada does not imply its endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.

=== Certificate Usage

==== Appropriate Certificate Uses

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable efficient and secure electronic communication, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of Certificates, and Verified Marks, and Government Marks. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates, and Verified Marks, and Government Marks.

==== Prohibited Certificate Uses

No Stipulation.

=== Policy administration

The Verified Mark Certificate Requirements present criteria established by the AuthIndicators Working Group for use by Certification Authorities when issuing, maintaining, and revoking Verified Mark Certificates. This document may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the AuthIndicators Working Group. Because one of the primary beneficiaries of this document is the end user, the AuthIndicators Working Group openly invites anyone to make recommendations and suggestions by email to https://bimigroup.org/contact-us/. AuthIndicators Working Group members value all input, regardless of source, and will seriously consider all such input.

==== Organization Administering the Document

The Request Token SHALL incorporate the key used in the certificate request.

A Request Token MAY include a timestamp to indicate when it was created.

A Request Token MAY include other information to ensure its uniqueness.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future.

A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA SHALL NOT re-use it for a subsequent validation.

NOTE: Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to:

(i) a hash of the public key; or

(ii) a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; or

(iii) a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR.

A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data. If a CA wanted to always use a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR as a Request Token and did not want to incorporate a timestamp and did want to allow certificate key re-use then the applicant might use the challenge password in the creation of a CSR with OpenSSL to ensure uniqueness even if the subject and key are identical between subsequent requests.

*Note*: This simplistic shell command produces a Request Token which has a timestamp and a hash of a CSR.

``echo `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M` `sha256sum <r2.csr` \| sed "s/[ -]//g"``

The script outputs:

``201602251811c9c863405fe7675a3988b97664ea6baf442019e4e52fa335f406f7c5f26cf14f``

. The entity is not listed on any government denial list or prohibited list (e.g., trade embargo) under the laws of the CA's jurisdiction.

===== Government Entity Subjects

An Applicant qualifies as a Government Entity if:

. The entity's legal existence was established by the political subdivision in which the entity operates;
. The entity is not in any country where the CA is prohibited from doing business or issuing a certificate by the laws of the CA's jurisdiction; and

==== Verification Requirements - Overview

Before issuing an Verified Mark Certificate, the CA MUST ensure that all Subject organization information to be included in the VMC conforms to the requirements of, and is verified in accordance with, these Requirements and matches the information confirmed and documented by the CA pursuant to its verification processes. Such verification processes are intended to accomplish the following:

. Verify Applicant's existence and identity, including;
.. Verify the Applicant's legal existence and identity (as more fully set forth in <<_initial_identity_validation>> herein),
.. Verify the Applicant's physical existence (business presence at a physical address), and

.. Verify that a Certificate Approver has signed or otherwise approved the Verified Mark Certificate Request.

==== Acceptable Methods of Verification - Overview

As a general rule, the CA is responsible for taking all verification steps reasonably necessary to satisfy each of the Verification Requirements set forth in the subsections below. The Acceptable Methods of Verification set forth in each of <<_verification_of_applicants_legal_existence_and_identity>> through <<_final_cross_correlation_and_due_diligence>> (which usually include alternatives) are considered to be the minimum acceptable level of verification required of the CA. In all cases, however, the CA is responsible for taking any additional verification steps that may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the applicable Verification Requirement.

==== Verification of Applicant's Legal Existence and Identity - Assumed Name

===== Verification Requirements

If, in addition to the Applicant's formal legal name, as recorded with the applicable Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration, the Applicant's identity, as asserted in the Verified Mark Certificate, is to contain any assumed name (also known as “doing business as”, “DBA”, or “d/b/a” in the US, and “trading as” in the UK) under which the Applicant conducts business, the CA MUST verify that:

. the Applicant has registered its use of the assumed name with the appropriate government agency for such filings in the jurisdiction of its Place of Business (as verified in accordance with these Guidelines), and
. that such filing continues to be valid.

===== Acceptable Method of Verification

To verify any assumed name under which the Applicant conducts business:

. The CA MAY verify the assumed name through use of a Qualified Government Information Source operated by, or on behalf of, an appropriate government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's Place of Business, or by direct contact with such government agency in person or via mail, e-mail, Web address, or telephone; or
. The CA MAY verify the assumed name through use of a Qualified Independent Information Source provided that the QIIS has verified the assumed name with the appropriate government agency.
. The CA MAY rely on a Verified Professional Letter that indicates the assumed name under which the Applicant conducts business, the government agency with which the assumed name is registered, and that such filing continues to be valid.

==== Verification of Applicant's Physical Existence

===== Address of Applicant's Place of Business

====== Verification Requirements

To verify the Applicant's physical existence and business presence, the CA MUST verify that the physical address provided by the Applicant is an address where the Applicant or a Parent/Subsidiary Company conducts business operations (not, for example, a mail drop or P.O. box, or 'care of' (C/O) address, such as an address for an agent of the Organization), and is the address of the Applicant's Place of Business.

====== Acceptable Methods of Verification

. Place of Business in the Country of Incorporation or Registration
+
For Applicants whose Place of Business is in the same country as the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and whose Place of Business is NOT the same as that indicated in the relevant Qualified Government Information Source used in <<_verification_of_applicants_legal_existence_and_identity>> to verify legal existence:

===== Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2

Confirming the Applicant's control over the FQDN by verifying that the Request Token or Random Value is contained in the contents of a file.

. The entire Request Token or Random Value MUST NOT appear in the request used to retrieve the file, and
. the CA MUST receive a successful HTTP response from the request (meaning a 2xx HTTP status code must be received).

The file containing the Request Token or Random Number:

. MUST be located on the Authorization Domain Name, and
. MUST be located under the "/.well-known/pki-validation" directory, and
. MUST be retrieved via either the "http" or "https" scheme, and
. MUST be accessed over an Authorized Port.

If the CA follows redirects the following apply:

. Redirects MUST be initiated at the HTTP protocol layer (e.g. using a 3xx status code).
. Redirects MUST be the result of an HTTP status code result within the 3xx Redirection class of status codes, as defined in RFC 7231, Section 6.4.
. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs with either via the "http" or "https" scheme.
. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs accessed via Authorized Ports.

If a Random Value is used, then:

. The CA MUST provide a Random Value unique to the certificate request.
. The Random Value MUST remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values, in which case the CA MUST follow its CPS.

NOTE: Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the CA MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN.

===== Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME

Confirming the Applicant's control over a FQDN by validating domain control of the FQDN using the ACME HTTP Challenge method defined in section 8.3 of RFC 8555. The following are additive requirements to RFC 8555.

The CA MUST receive a successful HTTP response from the request (meaning a 2xx HTTP status code must be received).

The token (as defined in RFC 8555, section 8.3) MUST NOT be used for more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values, in which case the CA MUST follow its CPS.

If the CA follows redirects:

. Redirects MUST be initiated at the HTTP protocol layer (e.g. using a 3xx status code).
. Redirects MUST be the result of an HTTP status code result within the 3xx Redirection class of status codes, as defined in RFC 7231, Section 6.4.
. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs with either via the "http" or "https" scheme.
. Redirects MUST be to resource URLs accessed via Authorized Ports.

NOTE: Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the CA MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN.

===== TLS Using ALPN

Confirming the Applicant's control over a FQDN by validating domain control of the FQDN by negotiating a new application layer protocol using the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Extension [RFC7301] as defined in RFC 8737. The following are additive requirements to RFC 8737.

The token (as defined in RFC 8737, section 3) MUST NOT be used for more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for the token, in which case the CA MUST follow its CPS.

==== CAA Records for Verified Mark Certificates

. As part of the issuance process, the CA MUST check for CAA records and follow the processing instructions found, for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued, as specified in Subsection (2). If the CA issues, they MUST do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.
+
--
This stipulation does not prevent the CA from checking CAA records at any other time.

RFC 8659 requires that CAs "MUST NOT issue a certificate unless either:

. the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA Resource Record set or
. an exception specified in the relevant Certificate Policy or Certification Practices Statement applies."

For issuances conforming to these Requirements, CAs MUST NOT rely on any exceptions specified in their CP or CPS unless they are one of the following:
. CAA checking is optional for certificates for which a Certificate Transparency pre-certificate was created and logged in at least one public log listed in <<_ct_logs_approved_by_authindicators_working_group>>, and for which CAA was checked.
. CAA checking is optional if the CA or an Affiliate of the CA is the DNS Operator (as defined in RFC 7719) of the domain's DNS.

CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:

. the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and
. the lookup has been retried at least once; and
. the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.

CAs MUST document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record and SHOULD dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), If present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.
--

. Prior to the issuance of Verified Mark Certificates, the CA MUST check for the publication of a Relevant RRSet for each FQDN to be included in a dNSName within the Verified Mark Certificate's subjectAlternativeName extension. The Relevant RRSet for each FQDN must be determined using the algorithm defined in section 3 of RFC 8659.
+
--
For each FQDN, if a Relevant RRSet exists, the CA MUST NOT issue the Certificate unless the CA determines that the certificate request is consistent with the Relevant RRSet. If the Relevant RRSet for an FQDN does not contain any Property Tags that restrict issuance of a Verified Mark Certificate and does not contain any unrecognized Property Tags that are marked critical, then the Relevant RRSet does not restrict issuance of a Verified Mark Certificate containing the given FQDN. In particular, CAA records with “issue” and “issuewild” Property Tags do not restrict the issuance of Verified Mark Certificates.

If a CAA record with the “issuevmc” Property Tag is present in the Relevant RRset for an FQDN, it is a request that the CA:

. Perform CAA issue restriction processing for the FQDN, and
. Grant authorization to issue Verified Mark Certificates containing that FQDN to the holder of the issuer-domain-name or a party acting under the explicit authority of the holder of the issuer-domain-name.

The sub-syntax of the “issuevmc” Property Tag value is the same as the “issue” Property Tag as defined in section 4.2 of RFC 8659. The semantics of the “issuevmc” Property Tag are similar to the “issue” Property Tag, with the only difference being that the “issuevmc” Property Tag restricts issuance of Verified Mark Certificates as opposed to TLS Server Authentication Certificates.
--

==== Mark Verification in Verified Mark Certificates

In addition to the identity and domain verification required by <<_initial_identity_validation>>, CAs issuing Verified Mark Certificates SHALL perform verification of the submitted Mark as follows:

===== Registered Mark Verification

====== Verification of Mark with Trademark Office

The Subscriber will provide the CA with:

 . the Registered Mark's trademark registration number and name of the Trademark Office that granted the trademark registration, and
 . the Mark Representation in SVG format that the Applicant wishes to include in the Verified Mark Certificate. Registered Marks must be in good standing and MUST be verified through consultation with the official database of the applicable Trademark Office, to be eligible for inclusion within a Verified Mark Certificate. In addition, only Registered Marks are eligible for inclusion within the logotype (as defined in RFC3709). For clarity and without limitation, unregistered marks are not eligible as a logotype in the registered mark profile.

In the alternative, the CA MAY verify the Registered Mark through the WIPO Global Brand Database at https://www.wipo.int/reference/en/branddb/.

====== Verification of Registered Mark Ownership or License

The CA SHALL confirm that the owner of the Registered Mark identified in the official database of the applicable Trademark Office or the WIPO Global Brand Database is the same Subject organization verified by the Verified Mark vetting process under <<_initial_identity_validation>> (or to a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the organization as confirmed in accordance with the Verified Mark Requirements), or if the owner of the Registered Mark is not the same organization, that the Subject organization has obtained the right to use the Registered Mark through a mutually agreed-upon license from the entity who is the owner of record of the Registered Mark (or a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the owner). If the owner of a Registered Mark is not the Applicant, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate for the Registered Mark unless the CA obtains an authorization letter from the owner of record of the Registered Mark.  

In determining whether the Applicant is the owner or a licensee of the Registered Mark corresponding to the Mark Representation, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decisions and reasons therefor in the CA's records required in <<_verification_of_mark_with_trademark_office>>.

====== Confirmation of Mark Representation

The CA SHALL confirm that the Mark Representation submitted by the Subject organization matches the Registered Mark as it appears in the official database of the applicable Trademark Office or the WIPO Global Brand Database. In determining whether the Mark Representation matches the Registered Mark, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decisions and reasons therefor.  The CA may, but is not required to, follow the guidelines in <<_optional_rules_for_matching_mark_representation_submitted_by_subscriber_with_registered_mark_verified_by_ca>> for comparison of the Registered Trademark with the Mark Representation. 

The CA SHALL also retain a screenshot or other record of the Mark Representation provided by the Applicant and all information about the Registered Mark obtained from the applicable Trademark Office as well as all other supporting data that the CA relies upon in issuing the Verified Mark Certificate.

====== Color Restrictions 

Mark Representations in Verified Mark Certificates for Combined Marks and Design Marks SHALL only be in colors as permitted for the Registered Mark by the applicable Trademark Office. The CA SHALL examine the Registered Mark to determine what rights, if any, the Subject organization has to use of the Registered Mark in the colors of the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber. 

In determining whether the colors in the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber match the colors permitted by the Registered Mark registration, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decision and reasons therefor in the CA's records required in 
<<_verification_of_mark_with_trademark_office>>.

===== Government Mark Verification

VMCs may be issued to Government Entities for Government Marks under the Registered Mark Profile designated by a Certificate General Policy Identifier OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.53087.1.1) as described under <<_subordinate_ca_certificate>> and <<_subscriber_certificate>>. The CA SHALL confirm that a Mark or equivalent was granted to or claimed by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity (International Organization) (or granted to a private organization or other organization by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity [International Organization] through official statute, regulation, treaty, or government action) as it appears or is described in the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action and confirmed by a Mark Verifying Authority.

In addition to the identity and domain verification required by <<_initial_identity_validation>>, CAs issuing Verified Mark Certificates SHALL perform verification of the submitted Government Mark as follows:

====== Verification of Statute, Regulation, Treaty, or Action

The CA SHALL confirm that the Government Mark was granted to or claimed by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity (International Organization) (or granted to a private organization or other organization by a Government Entity or Non-Commercial Entity (International Organization) through official statute, regulation, treaty, or government action by confirming the grant or claim in publicly available records of the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action. The CA shall maintain a copy of the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action including all official references (e.g., statute or regulation number and jurisdiction) and a copy of the Mark image as contained in or referenced by the statute or regulation. Example: US Department of the Treasury - Treasury Order 100-01 approving the design of the Treasury seal which accompanies the Order, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 301(g).

The CA SHALL also retain a screenshot or other record of the Mark Representation provided by the Applicant and all information supporting the verification of the Government Mark obtained from the applicable statute, regulation, treaty, or government action.

====== Verification of Government Mark Ownership or License

The CA SHALL confirm that the owner of the Government Mark confirmed under subsection (1) is the same Subject organization verified by the Verified Mark vetting process under <<_initial_identity_validation>>, or if the owner of the Government Mark is not the same Subject organization, that the Subject organization has obtained the right to use the Government Mark through statute, regulation, treaty, or government action, or by a mutually agreed-upon license from the entity who is the owner of record of the Government Mark. If the owner of a Government Mark is not the Applicant, the Applicant may only use the Government Mark if the CA obtains an authorization letter from the owner of record of the Government Mark.

In determining whether the Applicant is the owner or a licensee of the Government Mark corresponding to the Mark Representation, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decisions and reasons therefor in the CA's records required in <<_verification_of_statute_regulation_treaty_or_action>>.

====== Confirmation of Mark Representation

The CA SHALL confirm that the Mark Representation submitted by the Applicant matches the Government Mark as confirmed under subsection (1). In determining whether the Mark Representation matches the Government Mark so confirmed, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decisions and reasons therefor. The CA MAY follow the guidelines in <<_optional_rules_for_matching_mark_representation_submitted_by_subscriber_with_registered_mark_verified_by_ca> for comparison of the Government Mark as confirmed with the Mark Representation.

====== Color Restrictions

Mark Representations in Verified Mark Certificates for Combined Marks and Design Marks SHALL only be in colors as permitted for the Government Mark by the applicable statute, regulation, treaty, or government action verified by the CA. The CA SHALL examine the Government Mark to determine what rights, if any, the Subject organization has to use of the Government Mark in the colors of the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber.

In determining whether the colors in the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber match the colors permitted by the statute, regulation, treaty, or government action verified by the CA, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decision and reasons therefor in the CA's records required in <<_verification_of_statute_regulation_treaty_or_action>>.

==== Mark Verification in Mark Certificates

The CA SHALL verify Marks using one of the following methods for use in Mark Certificates.

===== Proof of Prior Use

====== Verification of Prior Use of Mark for Minimum Period

This type of Mark Certificate is appropriate for Common Law Marks that are not Registered Marks.

The Applicant will provide the CA with the Mark Representation in SVG format that the Applicant wishes to include in the Mark Certificate. The CA SHALL verify that:
. a Mark that matches the Mark Representation is currently displayed on a website. The Applicant's control of the domain name of the website MUST be verified using at least one method specified in <<_validation_of_domain_authorization_or_control>>, and
. a Mark that matches the Mark Representation was historically displayed at least 12 months earlier than the date of Mark verification on a domain currently controlled by the applicant, where the historical display is verified via one of the Archive Webpage Sources allowed by these Requirements.

The CA SHALL also retain a screenshot or other record of the Mark Representation provided by the Applicant and all Mark images found during the verification process stated in the previous paragraph. 

====== Approved Archive Webpage Sources 

Validations of Mark Representations performed in accordance with <<_verification_of_prior_use_of_mark_for_mininum_period>> SHALL employ one of the following Archive Webpage Sources:

*	archive.org 

This approved list may be modified from time to time.

====== Color Restrictions 

Mark Representations in Mark Certificates based on proof of prior use shall follow the same color rules that apply to Common Law Marks in the applicable jurisdiction. 

In determining whether the colors in the Mark Representation submitted by the Subscriber match the colors permitted by the rules that apply to Common Law Marks in the applicable jurisdiction, the CA SHALL maintain a record of its decision and reasons therefor in the CA's records required in <<_verification_of_prior_use_of_mark_for_minimum_period>>.

===== Modification of Registered Trademark
	
====== Verification of Modification of Registered Trademark

The CA will perform the verification steps under <<_verification_of_mark_with_trademark_office>> and <<_verification_of_registered_mark_ownership_or_license>> for the Registered Mark that is to be the basis of the modification proposed by the Applicant. The Applicant will provide the Mark Representation in SVG format that the Applicant wishes to include in the Mark Certificate.  

====== Confirmation of Mark Representation

The CA may accept the following forms of modification of the Registered Mark in the Mark Representation:

. For Combined Marks, the location of any word mark elements MAY be rearranged in relation to the design mark elements (for example, the word mark elements may be relocated from the right side of the design mark elements to below the design mark elements, and MAY also include separating and stacking the word mark elements into a more compact area).
. For Design Marks and Combined Marks, a portion of the design mark element MAY be removed (but more than 49% of the design mark element SHALL NOT be removed), but the remaining design mark element SHALL NOT be altered from the original. In the case of Combined Marks, the word mark elements MAY also be relocated in relation to the remaining design mark element as described in (1).
. For Word Marks and Combined Marks where the word mark element consists of a single word, the one word MAY be separated into multiple parts which may be stacked or not.
. For Word Marks and Combined Marks where the word mark element consists of multiple words, MAY be separated into multiple parts which may be stacked or not, or the multiple words MAY be combined into a single word.
. Modified Word Marks MAY be shown in any font or color against a colored or patterned background.

The CA SHOULD review the modified Mark Representation to determine if the modification makes a significant change to the obvious meaning of the original mark (as compared to the Registered Mark), and if so should notify the Applicant that the modifications cannot be accepted as submitted but must be further modified.  However, the Applicant may continue to request a Mark Certificate with the requested further modifications at the Applicant's option.

As a requirement to accepting a modification in the Mark Representation from the Registered Mark, the CA MAY require the Applicant to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the CA from all claims which may arise from any party as a result of such modification. 

The following are examples of permitted modifications to registered Word Marks and word mark elements of Combined Marks.

====  Other Verification Requirements

===== Denied Lists and Other Legal Block Lists

====== Verification Requirements

The CA MUST verify whether the Applicant, the Contract Signer, the Certificate Approver, the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Registration, or Place of Business:

. Is identified on any government denied list, list of prohibited persons, or other list that prohibits doing business with such organization or person under the laws of the country of the CA's jurisdiction(s) of operation; or
. Has its Jurisdiction of Incorporation, Registration, _or_ Place of Business in any country with which the laws of the CA's jurisdiction prohibit doing business.

The CA MUST NOT issue any Verified Mark Certificate to the Applicant if either the Applicant, the Contract Signer, or Certificate Approver or if the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration or Place of Business is on any such list.

====== Acceptable Methods of Verification

The CA MUST take reasonable steps to verify with the following lists and regulations:

. If the CA has operations in the U.S., the CA MUST take reasonable steps to verify with the following US Government denied lists and regulations:

====  Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence

. The results of the verification processes and procedures outlined in these Requirements are intended to be viewed both individually and as a group. Thus, after all of the verification processes and procedures are completed, the CA MUST have a second Validation Specialist who is not responsible for the collection of information review all of the information and documentation assembled in support of the Verified Mark Certificate application and look for discrepancies or other details requiring further explanation.
. The CA MUST obtain and document further explanation or clarification from the Applicant, Certificate Approver, Certificate Requester, Qualified Independent Information Sources, and/or other sources of information, as necessary, to resolve those discrepancies or details that require further explanation.
. The CA MUST refrain from issuing a Verified Mark Certificate until the entire corpus of information and documentation assembled in support of the Verified Mark Certificate Request is such that issuance of the Verified Mark Certificate will not communicate factual information that the CA knows, or the exercise of due diligence should discover from the assembled information and documentation, to be inaccurate, If satisfactory explanation and/or additional documentation are not received within a reasonable time, the CA MUST decline the Verified Mark Certificate Request and SHOULD notify the Applicant accordingly.
. In the case where some or all of the documentation used to support the application is in a language other than the CA's normal operating language, the CA or its Affiliate MUST perform the requirements of this Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence section using employees under its control and having appropriate training, experience, and judgment in confirming organizational identification and authorization and fulfilling all qualification requirements contained in <<_personnel_controls>> of these Requirements. When employees under the control of the CA do not possess the language skills necessary to perform the Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence a CA MAY rely* on language translations of the relevant portions of the documentation, provided that the translations are received from a Translator.

==== Criteria for Interoperation or Certification

The CA SHALL disclose all Cross Certificates that identify the CA as the Subject, provided that the CA arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship (i.e. the Cross Certificate at issue).

=== Identification and authentication for re-key requests

==== Identification and Authentication for Routine Re-key

No stipulation.

==== Identification and Authentication for Re-key After Revocation

No stipulation.

=== Identification and authentication for revocation request

No stipulation.

== CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

=== Certificate Application

==== Who Can Submit a Certificate Application

In accordance with <<_retention_period_for_archive>>, the CA SHALL maintain an internal database of all previously revoked Certificates and previously rejected certificate requests due to suspected phishing or other fraudulent usage or concerns. The CA SHALL use this information to identify subsequent suspicious certificate requests.

The CA SHALL establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then the CA SHALL NOT accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.

==== Enrollment Process and Responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain the following documentation from the Applicant:

. A certificate request, which may be electronic; and
. An executed Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, which may be electronic.

The CA SHOULD obtain any additional documentation the CA determines necessary to meet these Requirements.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain from the Applicant a certificate request in a form prescribed by the CA and that complies with these Requirements. One certificate request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the aging and updating requirement in <<_performing_identification_and_authentication_functions>>, provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current certificate request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The certificate request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

The certificate request MUST contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant for the issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

=== Certificate application processing

==== Performing Identification and Authentication Functions

The certificate request MAY include all factual information about the Applicant to be included in the Certificate, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with these Requirements and the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. In cases where the certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA SHALL obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA SHALL establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

Applicant information MUST include, but not be limited to, at least one Fully-Qualified Domain Name to be included in the Certificate's SubjectAltName extension.

<<_certificate_operational_periods_and_key_pair_usage_periods>> limits the validity period of Subscriber Certificates. The CA MAY use the documents and data provided in <<_initial_identity_validation>> to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under  or completed the validation itself no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate. An authorization letter from the owner of record of the Registered Mark or Government Mark (as described in <<_verification_of_registered_mark_ownership_or_license>> and <<_verification_of_government_mark_ownership_or_license>>) may be reused for up to 1,858 days.

In no case may a prior validation be reused if any data or document used in the prior validation was obtained more than the maximum time permitted for reuse of the data or document prior to issuing the Certificate.

As an exception to the validation reuse period of 398 days defined above, face-to-face validation is not required more than once for any Subscriber Organization (or Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate) so long as the CA has maintained continuous contact with one or more Subscriber representatives and maintains a system for authorization by the Subscriber of new Subscriber representatives (or representatives of a Parent, Subsidiary, or Affiliate).  “Continuous contact” means the CA has one or more direct contacts with a Subscriber representative during the validity period of any VMC issued to the Subscriber or within 90 days of the expiration of the last of the Subscriber's VMC to expire.

After the change to any validation method specified in the Verified Mark Requirements, a CA may continue to reuse validation data or documents collected prior to the change, or the validation itself, for the period stated in this section unless otherwise specifically provided in these Requirements.

This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA's CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA MUST also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the AuthIndicators Working Group of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to the AuthIndicators Working Group and receiving confirmation that it has been received, so that the AuthIndicators Working Group may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section MUST be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA's CPS and a notice to the AuthIndicators Working Group, as outlined above, MUST be made within 90 days.

[appendix]
== DNS Contact Properties

These methods allow domain owners to publish contact information in DNS for the purpose of validating domain control.

=== CAA Methods

==== CAA contactemail Property

SYNTAX: ``contactemail <utf8emailaddress>``

The CAA ``contactemail`` property takes an email address as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid email address as defined in section 3.4 of RFC 5322 and extended by <<_initial_identity_validation>> of RFC 6532, with no additional padding or structure, or it cannot be used.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using an email address.

```
$ORIGIN example.com.

CAA 0 contactemail "domainowner@example.com"
```

The ``contactemail`` property MAY be critical, if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.

==== CAA contactphone Property

SYNTAX: ``contactphone <rfc3966 Global Number>``

The CAA ``contactphone`` property takes a phone number as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid Global Number as defined in RFC 3966 section 5.1.4, or it cannot be used. Global Numbers MUST have a preceding + and a country code and MAY contain visual separators.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using a phone number.

```
$ORIGIN example.com.

CAA 0 contactphone "+1 (555) 123-4567"
```

The ``contactphone`` property MAY be critical if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.

=== DNS TXT Methods

==== DNS TXT Record Email Contact

The DNS TXT record MUST be placed on the ``_validation-contactemail`` subdomain of the domain being validated. The entire RDATA value of this TXT record MUST be a valid email address as defined in section 3.4 of RFC 5322 and extended by <<_initial_identity_validation>> of RFC 6532, with no additional padding or structure, or it cannot be used.

==== DNS TXT Record Phone Contact

The DNS TXT record MUST be placed on the ``_validation-contactphone`` subdomain of the domain being validated. The entire RDATA value of this TXT record MUST be a valid Global Number as defined in RFC 3966 section 5.1.4, or it cannot be used.

[appendix]
== Authorized Trademark Offices for VMCs

This Appendix is intentionally left blank.

[appendix]
[#terms-of-use]
== VMC Terms of Use (“VMC Terms”)

All Mark Asserting Entities (MAEs) are required, as a condition of being issued a Verified Mark Certificate, to agree to these VMC Terms. Any and all use, display, or reliance on any Verified Mark Certificate (and any Mark Representation and any other data or information therein) by Consuming Entities, Relying Parties, and any other person, is subject to and conditional upon acceptance of these VMC Terms. The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.53087.1.1 in the Verified Mark Certificate incorporates by reference these VMC Terms. If any person does not agree to these VMC Terms, such person may not obtain, use, publish, or rely upon any Verified Mark Certificate or on any Mark Representation or any other data or information in a Verified Mark Certificate.

. Definitions.
+
Capitalized words will have meanings set out in <<_definitions_and_acronyms>> of the Verified Mark Certificate Requirements.
. Limited Right to Reproduce and Display.
+
The MAE hereby grants, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions in the VMC Requirements and these VMC Terms:
+
[]
--
. to the Issuing CA, a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to issue a Verified Mark Certificate that contains the VMC Marks and to log said certificate in a limited number of CertificateTransparency Logs as required by the VMC Requirements; and
. to Consuming Entities, a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use the VMC Marks in conjunction with internal logo recognition systems, and to host, store, reproduce, display, process, and modify as permitted by section 3.1 the VMC Marks only in direct visual association with communications, correspondence, or services authored or provided by the MAE from or through one of the same domains included within the Verified Mark Certificate's Subject Alternative Name field; and
. to certificate transparency log operators if different from the Issuing CA, a limited, non-exclusive,worldwide license to retain a copy of and to reproduce the Verified Mark Certificate to support a durablepublic record of those issued certificates, and for the purpose of permitting members of the public to audit the verification of Verified Mark Certificates.
--

+
No other license is granted to any other party, or for any other use.

. License Restrictions and Conditions.
+
Any Consuming Entity that incorporates or intends to incorporate the VMC Marks obtained through an issued and published Verified Mark Certificate into its products and services, agrees that its license to do so is subject to and conditional on the following:
+
[]
--
. Quality Control, Same Treatment.
+
The Consuming Entity may not distort at display time any Mark Representation obtained from a published Verified Mark Certificate, change its colors or background, modify its transparency, or alter it in any way other than to adjust its size or scale, or to crop it in a manner consistent with cropping performed on other Mark Representations displayed in the same context. If a Consuming Entity displays a Word Mark obtained from a published Verified Mark Certificate, it must do so in a neutral manner applied consistently to all Word Marks from all Verified Mark Certificates that are shown in the same visual context. The Consuming Entity may display a Mark included in a Verified Mark Certificate without also displaying a Word Mark included in the same Verified Mark Certificate, but the Consuming Entity may not display a Word Mark included in a Verified Mark Certificate without also displaying the Mark included in the same Verified Mark Certificate.
. No Partnership or Relationships implied.
+
Subject to an express agreement to the contrary between the Consuming Entity and the MAE, neither the VMC Marks nor any other content of the Verified Mark Certificate may be used or displayed in any way that reasonably implies any relationship between the Consuming Entity and the MAE, beyond the bare licensor-licensee relationship created by these VMC Terms.
. CRL or OCSP Checks.
+
Consuming Entities must check the Certificate Revocation Lists maintained by the CA or perform an on-line revocation status check using OCSP to determine whether a Verified Mark Certificate has been revoked no less frequently than every 7 days.
. Lawful Use
+
Consuming Entities may only use the Mark Representation in a Verified Mark Certificate in accordance with applicable law.
. Sufficient Ownership or License.
+
The MAE warrants that the VMC Marks published via a Verified Mark Certificate represent a Registered Mark (and Word Mark, if any) that the MAE owns or for which the MAE has obtained sufficient license to be able to grant the limited license in these VMC Terms, and that it will immediately revoke the Verified Mark Certificate if it no longer owns or has a sufficient license to the applicable Registered Mark (or Word Mark, if any). The MAE will defend and will be liable for any intellectual property or other claims against any Consuming Entity, Relying Party or CA that arise from the content of the MAE's application for a Verified Mark Certificate.
. No obligation to display.
+
The MAE acknowledges that Consuming Entities are under no obligation to display the VMC Marks in connection with content the MAE publishes that is associated with the domains the MAE owns or controls as a Domain Registrant, even if a communication or message is confirmed to be from the MAE and a suitable VMC Mark can be obtained and safely displayed from the applicable Verified Mark Certificate. Instead, Consuming Entities may choose to display the VMC Marks in accordance with these VMC Terms, or not display them, at their option.
. Termination.
+
Immediately upon revocation or expiration of the Verified Mark Certificate, the MAE will cease publishing or using the Verified Mark Certificate, and the license granted to Consuming Entities in Section 2.2 above SHALL terminate. The license to a Consuming Entity in Section 2.2 above also terminates automatically and immediately upon breach of any provision of these VMC Terms by the Consuming Entity. Consuming Entities must immediately cease any and all use of the VMC Marks upon termination of the applicable license.
. Updates to VMC Requirements and VMC Terms.
+
The VMC Requirements and VMC Terms may be updated from time to time. All parties agree that the version of the VMC Requirements and VMC Terms in effect at the time of issuance of a Verified Mark Certificate SHALL apply through the date of expiration or revocation of the Verified Mark Certificate (and, for those provisions that by their nature extend beyond the date of expiration or revocation, until the provisions no longer would apply by their terms). It is the responsibility of each entity who obtains, uses, publishes or relies upon a Verified Mark Certificate to review and familiarize itself from time to time with any updated versions of the VMC Requirements and VMC Terms.

== Additional F2F Verification Procedure

The Contract Signer or Certificate Approver for the Verified Mark Certificate must perform the F2F Verification Procedure for the Applicant according to the process described in _either_ Section 1 _or_ Section 2 below, as selected by the CA at its discretion. If the Contract Signer and Certificate Approver roles are fulfilled by different natural persons, then only one of Contract Signer or Certificate Approver must perform the F2F Verification Procedure. In all cases, the natural person performing the F2F Verification Procedure is referred to as the “Designated Individual” in the procedure defined below.

=== Notarization process for document signed by Designated Individual

If this F2F Verification Procedure is selected by the CA, the Designated Individual must perform the Notarization procedure for the Applicant as described below.

. Receive information from the Designated Individual
+
The CA will ask the Designated Individual to submit the following information: name, email address, and telephone number for use in the Notarization process described in Sections 2 and 3 below.
. Conduct Notarization Process
+
The CA will arrange for a Notary to meet with the Designated Individual. The Notary MUST NOT be an employee of the Subscriber or a member of any law firm used by the Subscriber. The Notarization process MAY be performed by Remote Notarization, provided that it is conducted in accordance with applicable law in the Notary's jurisdiction. The Designated Individual MUST be located in a jurisdiction in which the Notary is permitted to Notarize according to applicable law.
+
The CA will provide the Notary in advance with a Verification Document for the Designated Individual to sign before the Notary and be Notarized. The notary should be instructed to confirm the Designated Individual's face conforms to the photo on the Designated Individual's photo ID, and that the name of the Designated Individual listed on the photo ID conforms to the Designated Individual name on the Verification Document. The Notary must observe the Designated Individual as he or she signs the Verification Document, then Notarize the Verification Document, The Notary should record any required details of the Notarization process in the Notary's notary journal (or equivalent) as normally required in the jurisdiction for a Notarization. Digital signatures may be used if accepted in the jurisdiction.
+
The Notary must then either:
+
[]
--
. Send a photo or PDF copy of the Notarized Verification Document to the CA according to the CA's instructions and give the original document to the Designated Individual for his or her files or destruction, or
. send the original signed Verification Document to the CA. The Notary should not retain a copy of the Verification Document or the Designated Individual's photo ID in the Notary's own files unless required to do so by applicable law or regulation in the jurisdiction, in which case the Notary should treat the document and photo ID as PII to be archived and disposed of in a secure manner and in accordance with any applicable law or regulation.
--

=== Web-based F2F session with Designated Individual

If this F2F Verification Procedure is selected by the CA, the CA or its third party agent will perform a web-based recorded or photographed session with the Designated Individual. This form of validation must include the following basic steps:

. Receive information from the Designated Individual
+
The CA will ask the Designated Individual to submit the following information: name, email address, and telephone number for use in the web-based F2F process described in Sections 2 and 3 below.
. Process for web-based F2F session
+
The web-based F2F session will include the following steps.
+
[]
--
. The CA or agent initiates a live, recorded video conference with Designated Individual. The recording can either be saved by the CA, or appropriate screen shots of the conference can be saved by the CA instead.
. The Designated Individual recites on the video conference his or her basic information, including name, address, organization, title, telephone number, ID type (passport national ID, driver's license, etc.), and ID number that will be used during the validation session.
. The CA or agent asks the Designated Individual to present his or her ID document to the camera, close enough to provide a clear picture of the front, back, and any other pages as may be necessary to read and examine the document and capture it on the video and/or screen shots. The CA or agent is not expected to determine whether or not the ID document is genuine, only to record what was presented. The CA agent may reject the ID document at the CA agent's discretion if appropriate (e.g., expired, name mis-match, photo mis-match).
. The CA or agent asks the Designated Individual to hold ID in front of his or her face, to turn the document around in that position, and to wave his or her other hand in the space between the ID and the Designated Individual's face. The CA must make reasonable accommodations if necessary in case the Designated Individual has a relevant physical disability. The CA or agent may ask additional questions at his or her discretion.
. The video conference is completed. The CA or agent then approves or fails the ID verification request based on the procedure and securely archives the recording.
--

The CA may use a competent third party service provider trusted by the CA to perform this recorded or photographed web-based session with Designated Individual so long as the CA obtains and retains the recorded session and/or screen shots in the validation file.

=== PII and Privacy Requirements

==== VMC Designated Individual PII & Privacy Processes

The issuance of a VMC requires the issuing CA to validate the following information:

* The applying organization's ownership of their business domain
* The applying organization's ownership of the logo to be used
* The Designated Individual's connection to the organization
* The Designated Individual's identity

Due to the novel nature of validating the identity of the Designated Individual through F2F verification, which is performed either through a meeting with a notary or equivalent or through a web-based F2F session, additional information that is not typically collected for certificate issuance is required. As such, measures to protect the Designated Individual's personally identifiable information must be exercised.

==== Initial Designated Individual Guidance for Notarization process

. *Before* an applicant begins the Notarization process, each CA should:

* Set expectations and prepare the Designated Individual by providing a shortlist of items needed for and a brief explanation of the Notarization process and required personal documents and information:
** Description of the Notarization process that will be followed and PII details to be collected, including types of government-issued ID that will be accepted.

[appendix]
== Country-Specific Interpretative Guidelines (Normative)

_NOTE: This appendix provides alternative interpretations of the VMC Requirements for countries that have a language, cultural, technical, or legal reason for deviating from a strict interpretation of these Requirements. More specific information for particular countries may be added to this appendix in the future._

=== Organization Names

==== Non-Latin Organization Name

Where an Verified Mark Applicant's organization name is not registered with a QGIS in _Latin_ characters and the Applicant's foreign character organization name and registration have been verified with a QGIS in accordance with these Requirements, a CA MAY include a Latin character organization name in the Verified Mark Certificate. In such a case, the CA MUST follow the procedures laid down in this section.

==== Romanized Names

In order to include a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name, the Romanization MUST be verified by the CA using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation.

If the CA can not rely on a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, then it MUST rely on one of the options below, in order of preference:

. A system recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO);
. A system recognized by the United Nations; or
. A Lawyer's Opinion or Accountant's Letter confirming the proper Romanization of the registered name.

==== Translated Name

In order to include a Latin character name in the Verified Mark certificate that is not a direct Romanization of the registered name (e.g. an English Name) the CA MUST verify that the Latin character name is:

. Included in the Articles of Incorporation (or equivalent document) filed as part of the organization registration; or
. Recognized by a QTIS in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation as the Applicant's recognized name for tax filings; or
. Confirmed with a QIIS to be the name associated with the registered organization; or
. Confirmed by a Verified Legal Opinion or Accountant's Letter to be a translated trading name associated with the registered organization.

=== Country-Specific Procedures

==== Japan

As interpretation of the procedures set out above:

. Organization Names
.. The Revised Hepburn method of Romanization, as well as Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki methods described in ISO 3602, are acceptable for Japanese Romanizations.
.. The CA MAY verify the Romanized transliteration, language translation (e.g. English name), or other recognized Roman-letter substitute of the Applicant's formal legal name with either a QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter.
.. The CA MAY use the Financial Services Agency to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name. When used, the CA MUST verify that the translated English is recorded in the audited Financial Statements.
.. When relying on Articles of Incorporation to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name, the Articles of Incorporation MUST be accompanied either: by a document, signed with the original Japanese Corporate Stamp, that proves that the Articles of Incorporation are authentic and current, or by a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant Letter. The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Corporate Stamp.
.. A Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-lettered substitute name confirmed in accordance with this Appendix H-1 stored in the ROBINS database operated by JIPDEC MAY be relied upon by a CA for determining the allowed organization name during any issuance or renewal process of an Verified Mark Certificate without the need to re-perform the above procedures.

. Accounting Practitioner
+
In Japan:

.. Accounting Practitioner includes either a certified public accountant (公認会計士 - Konin-kaikei-shi) or a licensed tax accountant (税理士 - Zei-ri-shi).
